# Fluo

FLUO is a cryptocurrency developed to be the most sustainable project on the binance smart chain. It combines various safe token principles such as a fair launch and fully ownerless liquidity pool to achieve true long-term sustainability. FLUO was built for investors who want a stakeable, provably fair token.

## Fluo purpose

Many projects on the binance smart chain today are promising extremely high staking yields, up to 1000% APY. These projects are designed to attract enormous attention and afterwards result in a price crash. They share a lot of similarities with classic pump-and-dump schemes, making the token creators a lot of money, while the investors are losing money. We have seen this happen over and over again and decided to create a sustainable project, with fair yields. Fluo uses its own income-backed staking mechanism, which means that all staking rewards are paid out entirely by the income the network generates. To take it even further, we decided to go with 0 team tokens and distribute 100% of all tokens to the public (80% via the token sale, 20% through Pancakeswap). The pancakeswap LP-tokens (keys to the the Pancakeswap pool) are also immediately burned after listing, making Fluo a "rug-pull"-proof token.
