# Core principles

Fluo uses 4 principles to achieve long-term sustainability. These principles are reflected in both the Fluo smart contract and the token sale smart contracts.

## Fair Launch

Fluo is one of the first projects on the binance smart chain to provide users with a truly fair launch. No hidden team/dev wallet. No team tokens. 100% of all tokens are distributed towards the community: 80% is distributed during the token sale and 20% is locked up in the ownerless pancakeswap liquidity pool. The "keys"/LP tokens of this pool will immediately be burned after launch, making "rug-pull"-like scenarios impossible.

## Ownerless liquidity pool

After the token sale, 20% of all our tokens and 20% of the token sale proceeds will be locked in an ownerless Pancakeswap liquidity-pool. We achieve this by burning the all our LP-tokens to our pool, immediately after providing liquidity. The main reason we do this, is to make any rug-pull-like scenarios impossible. This makes it extremely safe to hold FLUO. After the liquidity is locked, we won't be able to remove any liquidity whatsoever.

Another advantage to ownerless liquidity is a growing liquidity pool. On each pancakeswap transaction, a small fee is paid, which is added to the liquidity pool. The owners can usually take out a small part of the pool liquidity to profit from these fees, but as our liquidity pool is locked up, this won't be possible. All fees will stay in the pool and grow the amount of available liquidity indefinitely, rewarding all token holders.

## Income-backed staking

Fluo's staking mechanism is very different from other projects. At fluo, all staking rewards are backed by the smart contract's income. This means no tokens can ever be are created/minted to payout stakers. The stakers receive tokens that are paid for by taxing transactions.
For each transaction, the sender pays a 2% tax. All these taxes are collected in a pool and distributed towards stakers.
The amount the stakers get is fully dependent on how many tokens they have staked.

## Truly deflationary

Fluo's smart contracts are designed to be truly deflationary. On every transaction, 2% of the tokens in the transaction are burned permanently (another 2% is distributed towards stakers). This is done to increase the value of each FLUO token over time. The deflation continues until only 10 million Fluo is left.

After launch, no more tokens can be created (even by the contract owner), as there is no minting function in the contract code. This is done to give our holders a piece of mind, as many projects on the binance smart chain claim to be deflationary, but are actually inflationary in practice.
